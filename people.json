The focus of the group is on network modelling, including random graphs, percolation, and inference. Graphs are an important paradigm for scientific research in the 21st century. The research programme spans the wide range of methodological developments and applied projects, from random graph models, sparse network model inference and systems biology, high-dimensional inference and inference of ODEs and SDEs.",

Typically, we drive research towards extreme-scale simulations in computational algorithms, application software, programming, and software tools. We are currently involved in several HPC and computing research and simulation projects that develop methods and applications targeted at the next generation of petaflop/exaflop architectures. Interdisciplinary cooperation is a key to the work of this group, which functions as a link between various branches of computer science, computing technology, and application areas ranging from applied mathematics, to various branches of the engineering and natural sciences.",
